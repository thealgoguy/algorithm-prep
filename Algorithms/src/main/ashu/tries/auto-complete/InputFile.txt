Autocomplete is a feature provided by many popular applications. It helps the user with typing by suggesting terms that start with the prefix typed so far. But if the underlying set of terms is large and only the top k matching terms are suggested, how can we efficiently implement such a feature? One approach is to use a data structure like the Suggest Tree presented here.

Basically, a Suggest Tree is just a compressed trie of the terms in which each node holds a weight-ordered list of the k highest-weighted terms in its subtree. 

Basis of trie there are many ways to implement the edges of a trie. .

Basement area has there are ternary search trees are sensitive to the order in which you insert the terms into the tree: If you have an alphabetically sorted set of terms and you insert first the middle term and then recursively the middle term of the left and right subsets, you end up with a balanced ternary search tree where the search space is cut more or less in half each time you go left or right in the tree. 

Preferred types that always looks as if the terms have been inserted in random order, no matter what the actual insertion order was, the ternary search tree underlying a Suggest Tree is randomized. 

Presently, reweight, or remove a term, the suggestion lists along the path from the term's terminal node to the root of the trie may need to be updated.

Given a file of 4 billion 32-bit integers, how to find one that appears at least twice
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7153659/find-an-integer-not-among-four-billion-given-ones
Say we want to fit all integers into an array in memory. How much memory to do we need? we take all the integers (2^32) or 4 billion roughly then multiply it by 4 since each integer is represented by four bytes. We would need roughly 16GBytes of memory to put all representable integers into an array

 Design patterns. Design tool if you’ve worked on any.
 
 how relational and non-relational databases work and what tradeoffs exist between them
 distributed computing concepts - understanding of topics such as service oriented architectures, map-reduce, distributed caching, load balancing, etc. could help you formulate answers to some of the more complicated distributed architecture questions
 
 OS topics that can affect code performance, such as: memory management, processes, threads, synchronization, paging, and multithreading

A document and a list of words are given. You have to find minimum length window in the document where all the words can be found.
implement a spell checker, which gives word suggestions based on the words which have already occurred

kth smallest element in single array- quick selelct, heap approach
kth smalles in two arrays - 
median of unsorted array in linear time - median of median algo, heap appl
LL - detect and remove cycle, clone with random pointer, sort/merge, union/intersection, Convert binary tree to doubly linked list, 
sorting of LL - merge/quick sort

design your own BitSet API. All the methods like flip, set, reset, countOnes, etc..What data structure will you use.
Sort 1 billion integers with limited memory. I told about sorting them chunk by chunk and then merging. He then asked me how to decide the chunk size. I explained with an example.Will this take the same amount of time if we have infinite memory. Itold about the access time difference in primary memory and secondary memory. Asked details about secondary memory, About disk technology, sector, seek time, rotational delay, etc.
searchin an integer in a huge file with limited memory - bit map with multiple passes
find largest k elements in a stream coming - use min heap of size k
find k most frequent words from a file - http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-k-most-frequent-words-from-a-file/
find words in  a matrix - trie
Rearrange a given array in-place such that all the negative numbers occurs before positive numbers.(Maintain the order of all -ve and +ve numbers as given in the original array)
k-way merge sort of k arrays
Given a string str. You have to make this string to square string with maximum length. A square string is of the following format:
str = x + x; where x is any string. Return length of this square string. Maybe LCS application.
Design undo and redo operation in Microsoft Word like text editor. Design hit counter.
You are given a text file. You have to return the list of starting index of the given word in text file. Design an efficient DS for that.

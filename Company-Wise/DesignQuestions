WhatsAPp messaging service :

Features : 
1. One-one text send. Or Group chat
2. Sent/Delivered/Read notofication : though acknowlegement sent by server to the sender after reciving the same from receiver
3. Push notification : fire and forget

Each message has a message id, sender, receiver, and content(text/video/file/etc)
Messages are deivered via an intermediate server, which has queue for every user. 
Since receiver may not be online, each messgae is queued at the server(there can be many server, hwo ordered deliver of messages is maintained ? My thought : we can have mesages arrived for a particular receiver byy a particular sender in a priority queue based on arrival time...so that older message are delivered first). These queues are
ephimeral(deleted once empty)
For push notification we can have other servers.

For storing message history and back up , we can use dropbox, or google cloud storage, etc.

Given a pattern containing only Is and Ds. I for increasing and D for decreasing. Devise an algorithm to print the MINIMUM number following that pattern. Digits from 1-9 and digits can’t repeat. 
Example: 
1. Input: D Output: 21 
2. Input: I Output: 12 
3. Input: DD Output: 321 
4. Input: II Output: 123 
5. Input: DIDI Output: 21435 
6. Input: IIDDD Output: 126543 
7. Input: DDIDDIID Output: 321654798

Maximize XOR of 2 numbers….(best solution is using trie)

Given k,n,m. where k is no. of coconuts you initially have. n is some no. such that if you have >=n coconuts, you become stressed otherwise you are normal. m is the no. of shops.You go from 1st shop to m-th shop without skipping any shop. At i-th shop, either you buy Si coconuts or sell Si coconuts. If you are stressed then you must become normal at next shop. If you have less than Si coconuts and you want to sell then you must sell all the coconuts you have. The task is to calculate maximum possible changes of your mood from stressed to normal or vice-versa Recursion with memoization.

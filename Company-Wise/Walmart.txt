Given a binary stream, check divisibility by a number n. rem = 0; while(bit coming) r = (bit==0) ? (2*r%n) : (2*r+1)%n; return r%n==0

Find median of a stream of integers at any time.
You have a stream of incoming integers. How will you store these numbers and implement following functions : GiveMax(), GiveSecond Max(), Delete Max(), DeleteSecondMax (), Add , Remove an element

**ALIEN language - Given an alien language dictionary where the words are sorted, we need to figure out the list and order of the alphabets for that language. 2 approaches - topological sort. 2nd - BFS using degree map(see leetcode)
Find out the longest repeating subsequence in a given string (Dynamic Programming)  - SOLVED. Find LCS(S, S)
Word ladder problem(BFS) : Given a dictionary containing some words, and a start word and end word, you need to find the minimum number of conversion needed to convert start word to end word with the following restrictions :-
1. Each intermediate word must be in the dictionary
2. You can change only one character in the word to convert to another word.
Example If You are given start word as ‘SAT’ and end word as ‘PAN
and the dictionary contains words = [‘RAT’,’PAT’,’DAM’] then SAT -> PAT ->PAN is the answer........SOLVED
word break problem(dp) - given a dictionary and a string, find if string can be partitioned into valid dict words. - SOLVED

----Matrix DP----
Largest sum rectangle in a matrix
Largest square submatrix with all 1s in a boolean matrix. dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]+1 if(a[i][j]==1) and = Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) if(a[i][j] != 1)
Largest rectagular area in a histogram
Largest rectangular submatrix with all 1s(DP approach, histogram approach)

House coloring(DP) : There is a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color. Find the minimum cost to paint all houses. -- https://www.programcreek.com/2014/05/leetcode-paint-house-java/ .Also see k-coloring soln with n stage dp...each stage has k choices). Also see house robbing problem where a robber has to maximime the eamount robbed without robbing consecutive houses.
Range [L, R] is given. Need to find what is the maximum repeating digit in prime numbers between L and R (both inclusive). If more number of digits is repeated max times, return whichever digit is maximum. Eg: [2, 13] – maximum repeating digit is 1 among {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}-- I solved on GFG
**Given a number in form of array, maximize the number w.r.t allowed number of swaps (can swap only adjacent elements) – maximize(int[] data, int numSwaps)
Eg: 1265 is number – if 1 swap allowed – maximum number we can get out of it is 2165. ---I solved it on GFG.
